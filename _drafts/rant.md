What happened to you guys?? Seriously WTF? You got so well for so long!

Even since before I left the womb you both kept me alive. Literally. I wouldn’t be where I am today without both your help. Why did you have to turn on both yourselves and me?

What happened to you (IM)? Please explain why you turned on us. Sorry but for the life of me I can’t understand what you’d turn on someone so close to you without any notice! There was nothing, not even a hint of what was about to happen and how it would affect us all so profoundly. Did you even realize yourself? Or was it just done on a whim? Clearly there was some justification, but I don’t see it... It’s like you just woke up one day and said to yourself “fuck it, I’ll attack (P) today and see what happens”. WTF!

(IM) you directly brought (D) into my life and it was sudden, jarring, painful, and will affect me and my family for the rest of my life. It affects me every single day, from the moment I awake to when I go to bed. I’ve been in hospital because of it. (D) directly affects me in was that I never knew possible. IM, while i know that you thought you were only doing your job, believe me, that’s not enough of an excuse. Fuck you very much. We have a love hate relationship now that will never change.

(D)iabetes T1, you can fuck right off....
